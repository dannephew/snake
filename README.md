## Project Name:
Snake

## Description: 
Snake is a classic game that first appeared in 1997 on the Nokia 6110. Today, it is played by many nostalgic individuals, myself included. I chose to build this game because I hoped to recreate a beloved childhood game for myself - with some edits. 

## Getting Started: 
[You can play the game here!](https://dannephew.github.io/snake/)

## Instructions: 
The snake is controlled by the arrow keys on a player's keyboard and gains a new segment for every piece of food it consumes. The player loses if the snake collides into obstacles, the border, or itself. The player wins by consuming all food on the board.

## Technologies Used: 
HTML, Javascript, CSS

## Next Steps: 
* Create popup for snake gif as soon as window opens
* Create popups for instruction and win/lose messages
* Show time left 
* Add buttons for one-player and two-players
* Create pleasing color scheme and snake title
* Create different levels for one-player snake game that increases in difficulty

## What I Learned: 
* Anything can be coded if I put in the time and effort
* Pseudocode is highly important to avoid going backwards and editing code when a new function is added
* Hard coding of any kind should be avoided. For instance, writing in the specific board length and width into functions makes it hard to add multiple levels that change in difficulty as the board length and width increase.
